2.  Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?
    The Architecture of Power BI service is based on 2 Clusters,
    1. Web Front End (WFE) cluster which handles the initial connections & authentication to PBI service.
    2. Bank end cluster which handles the subsequent interactions.
    
    PBI service uses Azure Active Directory(AAD) to manage mange user identities, AAD manages storage in Azure Blob & meta data into SQL database.
    PBI uses Azure Trafic manager to direct the traffic to nearest data center. This traffic manager uses DNS record of client trying to connect, authenticate
    and download any files or static content.
    Azure Content Delivery network (CDN) help Power BI to efficiently distribute the static content & files based on user location.
